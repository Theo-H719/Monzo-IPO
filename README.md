Monzo Bank (MONZO.UK) – IPO Investment Case
Target Listing: LSE (Primary) / NASDAQ (Potential Dual) Target Valuation: £6.5bn – £8.5bn (Implied) Date: February 2026

1. Executive Summary: The "Primacy" Pivot
Monzo has successfully transitioned from a "spending card" to a primary banking relationship for 12m+ UK customers. The FY25 profit inflection (£113.9m PBT) validates the unit economics of its digital-first model. The core investment opportunity lies in Monzo's ability to cross-sell high-margin lending and subscription products to a loyal, digitally native demographic that legacy banks are struggling to retain.

2. Valuation Framework: The "Tech vs. Bank" Dilemma
Monzo represents a hybrid asset class, creating a valuation tension:

The Floor (Bank Proxy): If valued like a high-growth bank (e.g., confident UK challengers), it trades on P/E and P/Book.

The Ceiling (Tech Proxy): If valued like a global fintech platform (e.g., Nubank, Revolut), it trades on EV/Revenue.

Our View: Monzo commands a premium over UK incumbents due to superior ROE potential and lower CAC, but a discount to global peers due to UK market concentration.

3. Key Growth Drivers (The "Bull Case" Engines)
ARPU Expansion: Moving from £187 to £250+ per user via mortgage cross-selling (Habito acquisition strategy) and wealth products (Seccl partnership).

Business Banking: The "Hidden Jewel." 625k SME customers generating significantly higher revenue per user (£542) with sticky, low-cost deposits.

US Optionality: A second attempt at the US market, focusing on the mass-affluent "coastal" demographic, offers an embedded call option on valuation not fully priced in.

4. Key Risks (The "Bear Case" Drags)
NIM Compression: Heavy reliance on Net Interest Income (70%+) makes the P&L sensitive to falling BoE base rates in late 2026.

Regulatory Cost: Mandatory APP fraud reimbursement (50/50 liability split) creates a permanent drag on operating margins for high-velocity payment platforms.

Valuation Overhang: A failure to secure a US banking license would cap Monzo's total addressable market (TAM) to the UK, limiting multiple expansion.
